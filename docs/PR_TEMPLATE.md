## PR Title

```
feat: implement compliance features and logging infrastructure for issues #592-595
```

## PR Description

````markdown
Closes #592, closes #593, closes #594, closes #595

## Summary

Comprehensive implementation of 4 interconnected issues:

- Self-service account deletion with 14-day grace period and data export
- AI insight generation reliability fixes with error handling
- Global mirror implementation audit and test coverage
- Structured logging and request tracing across all Edge Functions

## Issues Addressed

### Issue #592: Self-Service Account Deletion (COMPLIANCE - URGENT)

**Problem**: No way for users to download their data or delete their accounts
**Solution**:

- Data export endpoint returning complete JSON
- Soft-delete with 14-day grace period (recoverable)
- Scheduled hard-delete after grace period expires
- Proper CASCADE deletes for all related data

**Files**:

- `supabase/functions/_shared/logger.ts` - Shared logging utility
- `supabase/functions/delete-account/index.ts` - Soft-delete handler
- `supabase/functions/export-user-data/index.ts` - Data export endpoint
- `supabase/functions/hard-delete-accounts/index.ts` - Scheduled hard-delete
- `supabase/migrations/add_soft_delete_columns.sql` - Database schema

**UI Changes**:

- `frontend/src/features/settings/account-actions.tsx` - NEW
- `lib/features/settings/account_actions_button.dart` - NEW

### Issue #593: AI Insight Generation Fix

**Problem**: Users stuck in loading state with no insight generated
**Solution**:

- Postgres trigger automatically generates insight at 3-log threshold
- Flutter UI error state with timeout (30s) and retry button
- Manual "Generate Insight" CTA button as fallback
- Proper error messages instead of silent hangs

**Files**:

- `supabase/migrations/add_insight_generation_trigger.sql` - NEW
- `lib/features/ai/view/widgets/ai_insight_section.dart` - UPDATED

### Issue #594: Global Mirror Implementation Audit

**Problem**: Specification unclear if fully implemented
**Solution**:

- Comprehensive test coverage for all claimed features
- Audit checklist for: clustering, realtime pulse, themes, SVG fallback
- Performance benchmarks (1000+ pins)
- Test suite for clustering algorithm and edge cases

**Files**:

- `frontend/__tests__/features/global-mirror/global-mirror.test.ts` - NEW
- `frontend/__tests__/features/global-mirror/clustering.test.ts` - NEW
- `frontend/src/features/global-mirror/global-mirror-page.tsx` - UPDATED

### Issue #595: Structured Logging & Request Tracing (FOUNDATION)

**Problem**: Scattered logs with no correlation, no trace ID propagation
**Solution**:

- Shared JSON logger utility used by all Edge Functions
- Automatic request ID generation and propagation
- Trace ID returned in response headers for client correlation
- Consistent log format for Supabase log explorer queries

**Files**:

- `supabase/functions/_shared/logger.ts` - NEW
- All Edge Functions updated to use shared logger

## Implementation Order

1. **Start with #595** (foundation for all debugging)
2. **Then #592** (compliance - legal requirement)
3. **Then #593** (user experience fix)
4. **Then #594** (polish and test coverage)

## Detailed Changes

### Database Migrations

```sql
-- Add soft delete tracking
ALTER TABLE auth.users ADD COLUMN soft_deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE auth.users ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Add soft delete indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_users_soft_deleted_at ON auth.users(soft_deleted_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_deleted_at ON auth.users(deleted_at);

-- Setup CASCADE deletes for all related tables
ALTER TABLE log_entries ADD CONSTRAINT ... ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE comments ADD CONSTRAINT ... ON DELETE CASCADE;
-- ... etc for all related tables

-- Create Postgres trigger for auto-generating insights at 3-log threshold
CREATE TRIGGER on_log_entry_insight_check AFTER INSERT ON log_entries...
```
````

### Edge Functions

#### Structured Logging (Issue #595)

```typescript
const logger = createLogger("function-name");
const traceId = logger.info("Operation started", { userId }, incomingTraceId);
// Returns traceId in response headers for correlation
```

#### Soft Delete (Issue #592)

```
POST /delete-account
- Requires Stellar auth
- Requires confirmation phrase: "DELETE MY ACCOUNT"
- Marks account as soft-deleted
- Sets grace period end date (14 days)
- Hides profile immediately
- Returns traceable response
```

#### Data Export (Issue #592)

```
GET /export-user-data
- Requires Stellar auth
- Returns complete JSON export
- Includes: profile, logs, comments, transactions, social
- Includes summary statistics
- File download with timestamp
```

#### Scheduled Hard Delete (Issue #592)

```
Runs daily at 2 AM via pg_cron
- Queries soft-deleted accounts with expired grace period
- Permanently deletes via auth.admin.deleteUser()
- Cascades delete all related data
- Logs success/failure with tracing
```

### UI Implementations

#### Web/Next.js (React)

- Download My Data button - triggers export
- Delete Account button - shows confirmation modal
- Requires typing confirmation phrase
- Shows grace period end date
- Redirects to logout on deletion

#### Flutter

- Account Actions section in Settings
- Export data button with confirmation
- Delete account button with large confirmation dialog
- Requires typing confirmation phrase
- Shows countdown to permanent deletion

### AI Insights (Issue #593)

- Postgres trigger: Auto-generate when crossing 3-log threshold
- Flutter UI: Show "Coming Soon" for <3 logs
- Flutter UI: Show loading with 30-second timeout
- Flutter UI: Show error state with retry button
- Flutter UI: Show "Generate Insight" button if still no insight

### Global Mirror (Issue #594)

- Test suite: 40+ test cases covering all features
- Clustering math: Handles boundaries, same location, rapid zoom
- Realtime pulse: Verifies animation fires on new pins
- Theme support: Light/dark mode switching
- Performance: Benchmarks with 1000+ pins
- SVG Fallback: Tests actual failure scenarios

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Data export produces valid JSON
- [ ] Soft-deleted account can't login
- [ ] Grace period countdown shows correctly
- [ ] Hard-delete removes all related data (check CASCADE)
- [ ] Insight generates automatically at 3-log threshold
- [ ] Insight shows error state if generation fails
- [ ] Retry button successfully generates insight
- [ ] Global mirror clusters form at correct zoom level
- [ ] Pulse animation visible when new pins added
- [ ] Theme switching updates map colors
- [ ] SVG fallback displays if maps library fails

### Automated Tests

```bash
npm test -- global-mirror.test.ts       # 40+ tests
npm test -- clustering.test.ts          # Algorithm edge cases
npm test -- account-deletion.test.ts    # Soft/hard delete flows
npm test -- data-export.test.ts         # Export completeness
npm test -- insight-generation.test.ts  # Trigger verification
```

## Monitoring

### Structured Logs Queries

Find all errors:

```sql
SELECT json_data->>'functionName', COUNT(*)
FROM logs
WHERE json_data->>'level' = 'error'
GROUP BY json_data->>'functionName';
```

Trace a single request:

```sql
SELECT * FROM logs
WHERE json_data->>'requestId' = '[trace-id]'
ORDER BY json_data->>'timestamp';
```

Monitor deletion success:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE json_data->>'level' = 'info') as successes,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE json_data->>'level' = 'info') / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM logs
WHERE json_data->>'functionName' IN ('delete-account', 'hard-delete-accounts')
AND DATE_PART('day', now() - json_data->>'timestamp'::timestamp) <= 1;
```

## Deployment Checklist
