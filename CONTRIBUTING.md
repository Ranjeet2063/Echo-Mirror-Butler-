## 1. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) 3.10+
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) 3.10+
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (must be running)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ (for edge functions)

### Fork & Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Echo-Mirror-Butler-.git
cd Echo-Mirror-Butler-
flutter pub get
```

### Before pushing

Run these from the repo root to ensure formatting, analysis, and tests pass:

```bash
dart format lib test backend   # fix formatting
dart analyze lib test          # check for errors
flutter test                   # run tests
```

> **Tip:** Enable the pre-push hook to catch formatting issues automatically:
>
> ```bash
> git config core.hooksPath .githooks
> ```

If the CI formatting check fails, run `dart format lib test backend` locally and commit the changes.

### Local Setup

Run the app with the required `dart-define` env vars:

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-local-anon-key>
```

> Get `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from the output of `supabase start`. See [supabase/README.md](supabase/README.md) for full local Supabase setup.

## 2. How to Pick Up an Issue

1. Browse [labelled issues](https://github.com/Echo-Mirror-Butler/Echo-Mirror-Butler-/issues) — look for `good first issue` or `help wanted`
2. Comment on the issue to claim it before starting work
3. One issue per contributor at a time — finish or unassign before picking up another

## 3. Branching Strategy

| Branch                                     | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `main`                                     | Production — do **not** target PRs here |
| `development`                              | Default branch — all PRs target this    |
| `feature/issue-{number}-short-description` | New features                            |
| `fix/issue-{number}-short-description`     | Bug fixes                               |

Examples:

```
feature/issue-42-stellar-gifting-ui
fix/issue-87-auth-session-expiry
```

Create your branch from `development`:

```bash
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/issue-{number}-short-description
```

## 4. PR Checklist

Before opening a PR, confirm all of the following:

- [ ] Branch is named correctly (`feature/issue-{number}-...` or `fix/issue-{number}-...`)
- [ ] PR targets `development` (not `main`)
- [ ] PR description explains **what** changed and **why**
- [ ] PR description includes `Closes #<issue-number>`
- [ ] `flutter analyze` passes with no errors
- [ ] `dart format . --set-exit-if-changed` passes (no formatting diffs)
- [ ] No scratch files, debug prints, or commented-out code committed
- [ ] New features include tests where applicable
- [ ] `pubspec.lock` is committed if dependencies changed (never ignored)

---

## 5. Commit Message Format

```
<type>(#<issue-number>): <short description>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`

Examples:

```
feat(#42): add Stellar gift animation on live call screen
fix(#87): resolve auth session not persisting after restart
docs(#104): add CONTRIBUTING.md with full contributor guide
test(#61): add unit tests for mood log repository
```

---

## 6. Code Style

- **Architecture**: MVVM — keep views, viewmodels, and repositories separate
- **State management**: Riverpod only — no `setState` in feature screens
- **Formatting**: Run `dart format .` before committing
- **Lint**: No global lint suppressions (`// ignore_for_file`) without prior discussion
- **Naming**: Follow Dart naming conventions (`lowerCamelCase` for variables, `UpperCamelCase` for classes)
- **Imports**: Use relative imports within features, package imports across features
- **Dependencies**: The `pubspec.lock` file must be committed to version control. Do not ignore it. Only update dependencies intentionally (do not blindly run `flutter pub upgrade` without testing).

---

## 7. Local Supabase Setup

See [supabase/README.md](supabase/README.md) for full instructions on starting local Supabase, running migrations, and setting edge function secrets.

Quick start:

```bash
supabase start   # starts local Postgres, Auth, Storage, Studio
supabase db reset  # apply all migrations
```

---

## 8. Continuous Integration & Platform Builds

All pull requests targeting `development` run automated CI checks defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

- **Code Quality**: Dart formatting, `flutter analyze`, and unit/widget tests with minimum coverage gating.
- **Supabase Stack**: pgTAP database tests and Deno edge function unit test suite (`deno test --allow-all supabase/functions/test_runner.ts`).
- **Platform Compilation**:
  - `build-android`: Compiles `flutter build apk --debug` with Gradle caching and uploads the debug APK as a workflow artifact.
  - `build-web`: Compiles `flutter build web` to ensure web builds and plugin imports do not break.
  - iOS compilation (`flutter build ios --no-codesign`) is reserved for scheduled/release workflows to optimize PR turnaround time.
- **Automated Dependency Updates**:
  - Managed by Dependabot via `.github/dependabot.yml` covering `pub` (Flutter root), `github-actions`, and `npm` (`frontend/`, `server/`) on weekly grouped schedules.

## 9. Release Process

To cut a new release:

1. **Bump Version:** Update the `version` field in `pubspec.yaml`.
2. **Update Changelog:** Ensure the top entry in `CHANGELOG.md` matches the new version in `pubspec.yaml`.
3. **Commit and Tag:** Commit these changes and create a git tag for the new version (e.g., `v1.2.0`).
4. **GitHub Release:** Push the tag and create a new GitHub Release using the matching changelog section as the release notes.
